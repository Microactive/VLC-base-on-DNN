# Indoor-visible-light-localization-based-on-deep-neural-network

Indoor visible light localization based on deep neural network,which uses deep neural network to positioning.The average positioning error is 2.5cm
The train data and test data are from laboratoryï¼Œit's not mine. Sorry, I can't upload them.
